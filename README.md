# Demographics of AEA membership

Data were extracted from internal systems. Members complete the “Directory of Members” form in order to be included in the directory, which used to be like a telephone book in the old days. List is filtered by opt-in to receiving surveys sent out to the AEA membership.

## Notes
- “Student”: The information is not a status in the directory, and was only recently reintroduced it as a payment tier. Likely to be all missing (may be inferred from "Highest Degree completed")

- “Highest Degree Completed”:  reflects degree most recently completed as recorded in the directory, which should almost always yield the highest, but in (rare or maybe non-existing) cases where someone switches fields of study, is not guaranteed.  The “degree” field is free text and contains all manor of notation. Free text was extracted, and normalized by code present in this repository.
